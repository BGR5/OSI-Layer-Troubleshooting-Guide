    <h2>Problem #9: High Bandwidth Consumption</h2>
    <p>Bandwidth is the maximum data transfer capacity transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. The more data you transfer, the higher your bandwidth consumption. Because networks have a limit on the rate of data transfer, businesses need to manage their bandwidth usage to maintain optimal network performance.</p>

    <h2>Common Causes of High Bandwidth Consumption</h2>
    <strong>Multiple Users or Devices:</strong>
    The more users are connected to the network, the higher the overall bandwidth consumption.

    <strong>Complexity of Tasks:</strong>
    Cloud-based tools like CRM, project management apps, and file-sharing platforms can overload the network. Streaming, gaming, and large downloads also contribute heavily.

    <strong>Bandwidth Capacity:</strong>
    Businesses with limited data plans will encounter bottlenecks if usage exceeds their bandwidth cap.

    <strong>Network Congestion:</strong>
    Using a shared connection or relying on a congested ISP can throttle your bandwidth.

    <strong>Wireless Network Issues:</strong>
    Outdated routers or poor Wi-Fi coverage can result in weak signal strength, even with sufficient bandwidth.

    <strong>Malware and Viruses:</strong>
    Malicious programs may secretly use your network to send or receive large amounts of data.

    <strong>Software Updates:</strong>
    Automatic updates from OS and apps can cause unexpected bandwidth spikes.

    <h2>How to Fix:</h2>
    <ul class="fixes">
      <li>
        <h3>Quality of Service (QoS)</h3>
        Use QoS to prioritize bandwidth for critical apps like video conferencing or VoIP to ensure smooth performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Analyze Bandwidth Usage</h3>
        Monitor peak hours and traffic patterns via your router dashboard or third-party tools to detect overuse.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Use Network Monitoring Tools</h3>
        Real-time tools like PRTG or NetFlow Analyzer help detect bandwidth hogs and anomalies quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Set Access Restrictions</h3>
        Block non-essential websites or restrict devices during peak hours to free up bandwidth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Identify Bandwidth Hogs</h3>
        Locate users or devices consuming the most bandwidth and adjust their permissions if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Limit High-Bandwidth Activities</h3>
        Schedule or reduce activities like HD video streaming or gaming during business-critical hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Check Network Devices</h3>
        Ensure routers and modems are updated with the latest firmware for optimal performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Scan and Protect Against Malware</h3>
        Run antivirus scans and secure the network to prevent bandwidth abuse by hidden malware.
      </li>
    </ul>
