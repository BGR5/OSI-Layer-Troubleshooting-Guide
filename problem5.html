    Cables help us connect to the internet and transfer data. But sometimes, they can have problems that affect how well they work.

  <ol style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;">

    <li style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
      <strong>Loose Connections</strong><br>
      Loose connections are a frequent problem with cables. This happens when cables arenâ€™t plugged in properly or become loose over time. This can cause your device to lose power, have a weak signal, or your network to stop working altogether.<br><br>
      To fix this issue, check if all cables are plugged in firmly. If the problem continues, try a different port or connector to see if that solves it.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
      <strong>Worn Out or Damaged Cables</strong><br>
      Cables can get frayed from everyday use, leading to problems like losing connection, power issues, and errors during data transfer.<br><br>
      Common causes include too much bending, wear and tear, or pets/rodents chewing on the wires.<br><br>
      If you see any damage or exposed wires, replace the cable immediately. Always check your cables regularly and handle them carefully to avoid damage.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Bent or Broken Connector Pins</strong><br>
      Sometimes, connector pins can become bent or broken, especially if cables are handled roughly. This can cause poor connections, unclear audio or video, or no connection at all.<br><br>
      Check the pins for damage. Bent pins might be fixed carefully with tweezers, but broken pins usually require replacing the cable.
